# Battleship CLI (C)

A simple command-line implementation of the classic **Battleship** game
written in C.

## Features

-   Turn-based player vs player (or player vs simple AI, if implemented)
-   Grid-based board rendering in terminal
-   Ship placement and hit/miss detection
-   Win condition detection

## How to Build

``` bash
gcc main.c -o battleship
```

(If multiple source files exist:)

``` bash
gcc *.c -o battleship
```

## How to Run

``` bash
./battleship
```

## Learning Goals

This project demonstrates: - Structured programming in C - Working with
arrays and 2D grids - CLI input/output handling - Modular design using
header/source files
